## 1. Grant
Subject to this EULA, Device Native, Inc. (“**Device Native**”) grants Motorola/Lenovo and their designees a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to:
- (a) integrate the DNA SDK object code into Motorola/Lenovo Android system software (including launcher) and/or Motorola applications; and  
- (b) distribute such software **worldwide** (initial focus: **India**, **United States**, **Brazil**; additional markets as agreed in writing) on Motorola devices.

## 2. Use Restrictions
Except to the extent a third-party open-source license expressly permits, you shall not:
- modify, reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the SDK;  
- use the SDK to build a competing advertising platform or service;  
- remove or alter proprietary or license notices;  
- sublicense or redistribute the SDK except as embedded in Motorola software.

## 3. Ownership
The SDK is licensed, not sold. Device Native and its licensors retain all right, title, and interest in and to the SDK and all related intellectual property.

## 4. Open Source Components
The SDK may include third-party open-source components (“**OSS**”) licensed under their own terms, as listed in `META-INF/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.txt`. If there is any conflict between this EULA and an OSS license for a specific component, the OSS license governs **for that component only**.

## 5. Privacy & Data
The SDK performs on-device processing of local signals (e.g., app usage statistics, Android Shortcuts, device state) to enable ad delivery and relevance. The SDK is designed so that personally identifiable information (PII) is **not** transmitted off-device. The SDK may transmit operational telemetry/logs necessary to provide and improve Device Native services, as documented or agreed in writing.

## 6. Confidentiality
Non-public SDK materials and documentation constitute Device Native confidential information. You will protect them with at least the same degree of care you use for your own confidential information.

## 7. Support & Updates
Updates and new releases may be provided at Device Native’s discretion and are subject to this EULA. Device Native may deprecate older versions after a reasonable transition period.

## 8. Warranty Disclaimer
THE SDK IS PROVIDED **“AS IS”** WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION **MERCHANTABILITY**, **FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE**, AND **NON-INFRINGEMENT**.

## 9. Limitation of Liability
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, DEVICE NATIVE WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY **INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES**, OR FOR **LOST PROFITS, REVENUE, OR GOODWILL**. DEVICE NATIVE’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY WILL NOT EXCEED THE FEES PAID FOR THE SDK/SERVICES IN THE **12 MONTHS** PRECEDING THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO LIABILITY (**OR USD $0 IF NO FEES WERE PAID**).

## 10. Term & Termination
This EULA continues until terminated. Device Native may terminate for breach. Upon termination, you must cease use and distribution of the SDK and remove it from your applications/firmware. Sections 2–4 and 6–13 survive termination.

## 11. Export/Compliance
You will comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including export control and sanctions rules.

## 12. Governing Law; Venue
